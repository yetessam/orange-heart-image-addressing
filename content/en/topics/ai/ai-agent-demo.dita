  <p>Content Agent is an AI agent hosted on my Hugging Face Spaces account.  Although most models have already been 
trained to avoid harmful interactions and have a good grasp of language, this agent is provided with the Intel Polite Guard library tool and then
prompted to use that tooling to evaluate
whether or not text is polite. </p>
  <p>Even though Gen AI models can already perform language processing, defining specific tools and functions for the AI to use
 provides greater accuracy, accountability, and transparency.   
 </p>
  <p>The Content Agent was provided with access to the <xref href="https://huggingface.co/Intel/polite-guard" type="html" scope="external">Polite Guard</xref> NLP library that classifies text and then was provided prompts to use a structured process of setting up a task, running code, thinking about the next steps and making observations. 
 Even with this tool, the AI agent is still introducing its own perspective and decisions making into the process.
 In particular, the prompt ask the model to make suggestions to improve text which are 100% coming from the model rather than the Polite Guard tool.</p>
