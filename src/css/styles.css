/*
 * Welcome to styles.css!
 *
 * Use this CSS stylesheet to add additional CSS on top of the existing DITA OT CSS.
 * You can add your custom CSS
 * directly in this file, import a local CSS file, or include a CSS file hosted
 * in the cloud or on a CDN.
 *
 * To add your custom styles:
 * 1. Scroll down to the "Your Custom CSS" section.
 * 2. Insert your CSS rules there.
 *
 * To include a local CSS file:
 * 1. Create a new file (e.g., custom.css) in the same directory.
 * 2. Add the following line at the top of this file:
 *    @import url('custom.css');
 *
 * To include a CSS file hosted in the cloud or on a CDN:
 * 1. Copy the full URL of the CSS file (e.g., https://cdn.example.com/styles.css).
 * 2. Add the following line at the top of this file:
 *    @import url('https://cdn.example.com/styles.css');
 *
 * Note: Future updates to this file may include additional @import statements
 * at the top. Your custom styles will remain unaffected as long as they are
 * placed in the designated section or in a separate file.
 *
 * Happy styling!
