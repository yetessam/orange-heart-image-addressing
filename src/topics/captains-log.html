        Content updates and working out gallery problems.
       </p>
       <p class="p">
        One issue is that we're not explicity surfacing content addressing.  If the CID is is derived from taking the image itself and pushing it through a computation algorithm, known as a hash, that generates a unique identifier.  However, its not visible in this browser and how would the user know?
                   If we do expose the CIDs for the gallery images, those content identifier act as the address of the image and ensures that the image is the original image that was uploaded and hasn't been modified in any way.
I suppose we could view the images in IPFS.
       </p>
       <p class="p">
        How do you get metrics to determine whether this is faster and more reliable content delivery? 
 Tools like the

         CID Inspector
        </a>

        Today’s decisions: start with Fleek, don’t recreate the wheel when it comes to CSS, and start with RDF/XML. Stick some images into IPFS and then sign up for Fleek as my IPFS Gateway. Should I use RDF vs Property DBs? Asked Chat GPT for a series of options for hosting. Fleek is Web 3 friendly and I can also store my content on Github and publish that way, which opens up the content to multiple contributors.
