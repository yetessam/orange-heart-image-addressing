       Used Python to look at image metadata and then used exiftool to set metadata in test images. 
          Want to consider embedding metadata into image files in the pipeline vs delivering JSON file adjacent to the image.
          Logically, the only thing that you could really embed would be a IPNS since you obviously can't create an image, get the CID and then embed that CID into the file.  
          InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS) supports mutable pointers to IPFS nodes (immutable).

            I contributed "like" functionality by extending the React chat's Typescript.   Updated the Message data type with David Luecke/daffl to ensure that the handlers were propertly chained together.
           Good chance I'll use FeatherCloud again since it just works.  Ditto for Automerge, as it took care of the merging and managing the data for the chat.

        Content updates and working out gallery problems.
       </p>
       <p class="p">
        One issue is that we're not explicity surfacing content addressing.  If the CID is is derived from taking the image itself and pushing it through a computation algorithm, known as a hash, that generates a unique identifier.  However, its not visible in this browser and how would the user know?
                   If we do expose the CIDs for the gallery images, those content identifier act as the address of the image and ensures that the image is the original image that was uploaded and hasn't been modified in any way.
I suppose we could view the images in IPFS.
       </p>
       <p class="p">
        How do you get metrics to determine whether this is faster and more reliable content delivery? 
 Tools like the

        To do: push the HTML5 to a dev branch where I could have Beautiful Soup run through and make any other changes that are needed. Then when that's done, move to staging and then move to prod.

        Create mockups for physical layout for gallery wall space. Took first draft photographs of the art pieces and then loaded them into a new Miro board to create a 2D diagram of the physical gallery space. Scaling the images down to onto the Miro grid to result in a maximum wall width of 3 feet. Will need to pad everything by several inches to accommodate frames.

        Today’s decisions: start with Fleek, don’t recreate the wheel when it comes to CSS, and start with RDF/XML. Stick some images into IPFS and then sign up for Fleek as my IPFS Gateway. Should I use RDF vs Property DBs? Asked Chat GPT for a series of options for hosting. Fleek is Web 3 friendly and I can also store my content on Github and publish that way, which opens up the content to multiple contributors.
