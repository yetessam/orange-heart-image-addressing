<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Content addressing identifiers provide provenance for digital assets.  Leveraging cryptographic hashing, assets are identified uniquely by their contents.    
  </p>
<p class="p">Content address identifiers (CID)s are derived by using an asset's cryptographic hash as its unique identifier.
</p>
 <p class="p">You can take any type of digital asset, a string, an image, a document, an entire website and load into a cryptographic hash, or function, the result is a unique
 series of numbers and letters for this exact image.   

</p>
<p class="p">

For example, if we take this website's logo  and push it thorugh a hash, it's CID will be xxx.   If you even make a minor change to the file, something that isn't perceptible to the eye. 

Or if it is a song, changing the recording in some way that's imperceptible to the ear, the CID will change.  It's not longer the original image or the original song, so it's now got a new identifier.

This CID in the decentralized web can be used as the asset's location address.

I can potentially share a link to this image and its quite possible that there are multiple copies of the same image on the dweb.  

All the links to this image are guaranteed to present you with the exact same, unaltered image since modifiying the image would change its CID.
</p>




  <p class="p">Additionally, as this is a globally unique ID, if I request this image, it can be retrieved from multiple locations.  Ideally, the closest place to me.  
This dovetails nicely with edge AI which is becoming increasing popular and also is based on retrieving and storing data closer to the user.  
Content's  authenticity can be easily verified by running the image through a hash and verifying that it is indeed the same image.</p>
   
   
  <p class="p">CIDs are text-based, unique properties of the content object. </p>
  <p class="p">If you've published a website and have a different version of the content, its CID will change.
  How we handle link management and other notions such </p>
  <p class="p">How is the use case handled for the "most recent" version of an asset/resource/website?</p>
