Getting a Fleek account.  I chose to authenticate through Ethereum, specifically with Metamask.  Metamask gives you some contextual warning about being careful with Web 3 dapps, but  I consented plus my wallet is pretty empty.   

Then once that went through, my Metamask extension in Firefox popped up to ask me to verify that I want to sign into the Fleek app via Ethereum.  

Set up an initial deployment yetessam/orange-heart-image-addressing (branch: prod) and selected src as the Publish directory 
Published at 10:01 AM to https://delicate-glitter-6121.on.fleek.co/

Locally ran  python -m http.server 8000 so that we can verify that the markdown is loaded locally,  checked developer console and made adjustments until we had zero errors in the console.

Pushed changes to design branch.

Create mockups for physical layout for gallery wall space.    Took first draft photographs of the art pieces and then loaded them into a new Miro board to create a 2D diagram of the physical gallery space.   Scaling the images down to onto the Miro grid to result in a maximum wall width of 3 feet.  Will need to pad everything by several inches to accommodate frames. 

Design branch on Git holds the current set of draft images.

Today’s decisions: start with Fleek, don’t recreate the wheel when it comes to CSS, and start with RDF/xml. Stick some images into IPFS and then sign up for Fleek as my IPFS Gateway. Should I use RDF vs Property DBs? Asked Chat GPT for a series of options for hosting. Fleek is Web 3 friendly and I can also store my content on Github and publish that way, which opens up the content to multiple contributors.

✅ Created a Github Repo https://github.com/yetessam/orange-heart-image-addressing
