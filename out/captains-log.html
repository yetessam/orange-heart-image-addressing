                    <p class="p">Built a job to check out the dev branch and move the output from the DITA OT into dev after processing it with Python so that it contains sufficient CSS selectors for Bulma. Pondering extending the HTML or bootstrap DITA OT plug-ins.</p>

                    <p class="p">Priming more birchwood and prototyped using Krylon clear spray on top of Sharpie Oil (fail), a regular Sharpie was fine! Smudging is an issue. Also prepared the background for the 16 x 20 piece, glued it down, waited 24 hours and then need to spray it with the fixative. Then wait another 24 hours to apply the stencil.</p>
                    <p class="p">Places where nobody will bother you about spray paint in Strathcona are filled with people living in cars.</p>

                    <p class="p">I've been getting these wooden birchwood boxes to do real-life art. Having to prime them and pull together supplies.</p>
                    <p class="p">I've done a few prototypes which didn't work out and then I primed again. Currently, still concerned that the Krylon matte fixative makes inks bleed including the Sharpie black oil ink. Went back to 'regular' Sharpie and still need to test the fixative. Finished the background for the 16 x 20 piece.</p>
                    <p class="p">Working on Github to source the content in DITA XML so that we can leverage DITA's link management. Created a dita branch on Github that takes the XML files, pushes them through the HTML5 transform in the latest version of the DITA Open Toolkit and then checks in the content to the out folder.</p>
                    <p class="p">Seems like it's going to be more efficient to generate this HTML here.</p>
                    <p class="p">To do: push the HTML5 to a dev branch where I could have Beautiful Soup run through and make any other changes that are needed. Then when that's done, move to staging and then move to prod.</p>

Took first draft photographs of the art pieces and then loaded them into a new Miro board to create a 2D diagram of the physical gallery space.

                    <p class="p">Today’s decisions: start with Fleek, don’t recreate the wheel when it comes to CSS, and start with RDF/XML. Stick some images into IPFS and then sign up for Fleek as my IPFS Gateway. Should I use RDF vs Property DBs? Asked Chat GPT for a series of options for hosting. Fleek is Web 3 friendly and I can also store my content on Github and publish that way, which opens up the content to multiple contributors.</p>
