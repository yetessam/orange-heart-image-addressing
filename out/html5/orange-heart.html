        <p class="p">IPFS images use content addressing which is derived from taking the image itself and pushing it through a computation algorithm, known as a hash, that generates a unique identifier.
        This content identifier acts as the address of the image and ensures that the image is the original image that was uploaded and hasn't been modified in any way.</p>
